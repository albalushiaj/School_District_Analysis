# ****School_District_Analysis****

## Overview of Project
- To see how the different districts/schools/students fared in relation to their student grades, funding, size, and school type. Using the student and school dataset that has already been combed through and Jupyter notebook, results were created for the analysis of the school district.  
- The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, **reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders** appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.
  -  To replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
  -  Once the math and reading scores have been replaces, the school district analysis was repeated leading to this written report.
-----------------

## Results: 
- How is the district summary affected?
  - The district summary is faintly effected from the lower scores, and  overall passing percentage from removing the Thomas High School 9th grade data.
